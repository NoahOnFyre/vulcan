# Vulcan
Vulcan is an extendable CLI for Windows, providing Linux features and a better terminal experience. 

# Installation
- Install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and apply it to your Windows Terminal.*

- Add the [Vulcan Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noahonfyre/vulcan/master/requirements/theme.json) Terminal Theme to your JSON config and set it as your default Theme.*

- Install Vulcan by executing the following command in your PowerShell:
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noahonfyre/vulcan/master/requirements/install.ps1 | iex
```

- Create a terminal profile named "Vulcan" and let it point to `v.exe`

Note (*): You don't necessarily need those dependencies,
but they improve the appearance of Vulcan a lot,
and it is extremely recommended to use them.
