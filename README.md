# Vulcan
Vulcan is an extendable CLI for Windows, providing Linux features and a better terminal experience. 

# Installation
1. Install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and apply it to your Windows Terminal.*
2. Add the [Vulcan Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noahonfyre/vulcan/master/requirements/theme.json) Terminal Theme to your JSON config.*
3. Install Vulcan by executing `will be added soon` in your PowerShell.
4. Create a terminal profile named "Vulcan" and let it point to `v.exe`

Note (*): You don't necessarily need those dependencies,
but they improve the appearance of Vulcan a lot,
and it is extremely recommended to use them.
